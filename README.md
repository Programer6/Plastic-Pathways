# Plastic-Pathways

Inspiration:
Our inspiration stemmed from the urgent need to address plastic pollution in our oceans. We wanted to create an interactive, educational tool to help people visualize and understand the journey of plastic waste from disposal to its harmful impact on marine ecosystems.

What it does:
Plastic Pathways is a web-based interactive experience that simulates the journey of a plastic bottle from a landfill to the ocean. It educates users about plastic waste's environmental impact and offers tips on how to reduce plastic pollution.

Problem it solves:
This project raises awareness about the environmental impact of plastic waste by providing an immersive learning experience. It aims to encourage more sustainable behavior and reduce plastic waste through education.

Technologies used:
The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and interactive web experience. Animations and images enhance the user interface, making the educational journey more visually compelling and memorable.
